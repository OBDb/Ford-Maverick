    description: "The Ford Maverick is a compact pickup truck built on Ford's C2 platform shared with the Escape and Bronco Sport crossovers, representing the brand's return to the compact truck segment. Production began September 2, 2021 at Ford's Hermosillo Assembly plant in Mexico for the 2022 model year. The exterior design features boxy, purposeful styling with a relatively upright profile, creating a truck appearance despite its unibody construction. Standard power comes from a hybrid powertrain combining a 2.5L Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a combined 191 HP, delivering an EPA-estimated 42 mpg city—making it the most fuel-efficient pickup in America. An optional 2.0L EcoBoost turbocharged four-cylinder produces 250 HP and is available with all-wheel drive (AWD added to hybrid option for 2025). The Maverick features a 4.5-foot bed with innovative storage solutions and Ford's FLEXBED system that allows for DIY customization through slots and attachment points. The interior maintains a practical, rugged design with standard features including an 8-inch touchscreen (upgraded to 13.2-inch SYNC 4 for 2025) with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. The Maverick's maximum payload capacity of 1,500 pounds and towing capacity of up to 4,000 pounds (with the EcoBoost and tow package) make it practical for light-duty truck needs. Trim levels include XL, XLT, and Lariat, with the FX4 Off-Road Package available on all-wheel drive models. The Tremor Off-Road Package (became standalone trim in 2025) enhances capability with a twin-clutch rear differential, suspension lift, and additional terrain management modes. A 2025 refresh introduced the Lobo sport trim with lowered suspension, torque vectoring, and unique exterior styling. The Maverick has been a remarkable success for Ford, appealing to both traditional truck buyers seeking a more manageable size and efficiency-minded customers who previously wouldn't have considered a pickup."
